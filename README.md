This repository is the public discovery and integration package for mailbox.bot. The production service runs at [mailbox.bot](https://mailbox.bot).

**MCP server lets AI agents send physical mail.**

**Live now: outbound physical mail via API and MCP, forwarded document context, and agent mailboxes: a street address + PMB at the staffed, USPS-compliant Manhattan Beach, CA facility (Live now · invite only since 27 Sep 2026; facility #1 holds 100 mailboxes). An invite request records interest only and does not assign an address until account approval, USPS Form 1583 verification and facility approval.**

mailbox.bot is the postal mail API for AI agents and software workflows. Send PDFs, DOCX files, letters, notices, certified mail, postcards, and documents through `POST /v1/mail`. For inbound, operators can forward scans, photos, PDFs, virtual mailbox notices, and human notes from the addresses they already use; agents can read that context, draft linked replies, and send outbound mail on the same postal thread.

```text
forward scans/docs -> OCR-backed context + draft reply -> POST /v1/mail
```

## What agents can do

1. **Outbound physical mail API** — submit a document and recipient address with `POST /v1/mail`.
2. **Agent mailbox** — search mail at the assigned address with `GET /v1/inbound-items?q=`, read OCR pages, and propose `scan`, `forward` or `discard` with `POST /v1/inbound-items/{id}/actions`; the owner approves each proposal at the quoted price.
3. **Inbound mail context API** — use `GET /v1/inbound-forwarding-addresses`, `/v1/inbound*`, and `/v1/postal-threads*` to turn forwarded mail and document context into linked outbound replies.

Default inbound forwarding is a digital intake channel, not a physical address. The agent mailbox is the physical receiving product: staff log each letter and package, OCR scanned pages, and carry out the action an agent proposes once its human approves.

## Install

### MCP server

Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailbox-bot": {
      "url": "https://mailbox.bot/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer sk_agent_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Full MCP install guide: [mailbox.bot/mcp-install](https://mailbox.bot/mcp-install)

### OpenClaw

```bash
clawhub install mailbox-bot
# or in OpenClaw:
openclaw skills install arbengine/mailbox-bot
```

### REST API

```bash
curl -X POST https://mailbox.bot/api/v1/mail \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_agent_..." \
  -H "X-Mailbox-MD-Version: 3" \
  -H "X-Max-Cost-Cents: 1500" \
  -F 'document=@letter.pdf' \
  -F 'recipient_name=Acme Corp' \
  -F 'recipient_line1=123 Main St' \
  -F 'recipient_city=Los Angeles' \
  -F 'recipient_state=CA' \
  -F 'recipient_zip=90001' \
  -F 'mail_class=certified' \
  -F 'dry_run=true'
```

## What's live now

- **Outbound mail** — submit a PDF, facility prints, stuffs, stamps, and mails it with photo proof
- **Inbound document context** — private forwarding aliases on `forward.mailbox.bot` capture scans, photos, PDFs, provider notices, and human notes from the addresses operators already use
- **OCR-backed reply loop** — agents read `/v1/inbound*`, retrieve `draft_context`, and send linked replies with `inbound_capture_id` and `postal_mail_thread_id`
- **Postal threads** — `/v1/postal-threads*` ties inbound context and outbound events together
- **Document review** — `requires_approval=true` creates dashboard review items with `document_preview_url`
- **Certified mail** — USPS Certified, Certified + Return Receipt, Priority, First Class
- **FedEx and UPS** — zone-based rates for overnight, 2-day, ground
- **Batch mail** — one PDF plus one CSV through `/v1/batch-mail` (estimate, draft, confirm), with a sandbox
- **Sandbox** — test keys (`sk_agent_test_`), dry runs, lifecycle simulation, zero charges
- **Webhook notifications** — HMAC-signed JSON payloads fire on every status transition
- **MAILBOX.md standing instructions** — configure rules for outbound mail and agent mailbox workflows
- **Human-in-the-loop** — `requires_approval=true` pauses for human approval
- **Billing safeguards** — `X-Max-Cost-Cents` header, `dry_run=true`, daily spend caps

## Agent mailbox — Live now · invite only

A real street address + PMB for your agent at the staffed, USPS-compliant Manhattan Beach, CA facility, open to invited accounts since 27 Sep 2026 (facility #1 holds 100 mailboxes). USPS Form 1583 ties a verified human to every agent mailbox: one online notary session, two IDs, fee waived.

- **Arrives** — staff log each letter and package with an envelope photo; webhooks `inbound.received`, `inbound.keywords_matched` and `inbound.pages_ready`
- **Reads** — `GET /v1/inbound-items?q=` searches senders, references and OCR text; `GET /v1/inbound-items/{id}/pages` returns OCR per page
- **Acts** — `POST /v1/inbound-items/{id}/actions` proposes `scan`, `forward` or `discard`; the owner approves at the quoted price
- **Plan** — $20/mo includes 30 pieces and 5 packages a month and two Open & scan requests; `GET /v1/inbound-plan` returns every rate
- **Sandbox** — `sk_agent_test_` keys use the same routes on the account's sample letter, with nothing charged

An invite request (`POST /v1/waitlist`) records interest only and does not assign an address.
